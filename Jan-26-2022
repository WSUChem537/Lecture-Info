For today's lecture:

1) you will work in small groups to work on plotting functions for HW#2
2) we will review energy minimization and begin on putting both the xyz and FF information into an input file for Gromacs and LAMMPS.
  -i have uploaded a pdf that reviews the steepest descent method
  -info on conjugate gradient method can be found here: https://akshayshah-96720.medium.com/conjugate-gradient-m-dfd9d2969e73 
3) online materials for lammps:
  -introductiom to LAMMPS input file: https://docs.lammps.org/99/basics.html
  -tutorial over LAMMPS can be found here: 
  -introduction to Gromacs input files: https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/5.1/user-guide/getting-started.html
  -tutorial over Gromacs (with examples): https://www.gromacs.org/Documentation_of_outdated_versions/Tutorials
  
  -some other web information associated with energy minimization in Gromacs is: https://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2019/reference-manual/algorithms/energy-minimization.html
  -web information associated with energy minimization in LAMMPS is: https://docs.lammps.org/minimize.html
