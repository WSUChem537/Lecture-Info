For today's lecture we will briefly go over your progress on HW#3, then we will finish our discussion on thermostats. 

I added some other simplified descriptions of numerical integrators into the 2-2 lecture folder. 

Finally, we began a discussion of thermo-mechanical equilibrium and ensembles - introducing the concept of the equilibration protocol.
