Today (and friday) we will discuss ab-initio molecular dynamics and introduce two papers that demonstrate its application in two different contexts: reaction mechanisms and spectroscopy.

In lecture we will review ab-initio molecular dynamics (also known as born-oppenheimer AIMD) vs. car-parinello (CPMD) ab-initio molecular dynamics (which approximates born-oppenheimer behavior), and briefly describe non-born-oppeheimer MD as well. 

online resources for AIMD and CPMD may be found at:

The major differentiator between BOMD and CPMD is that the former uses standard newtons equations of motion, while the latter uses lagrangian mechanics. We have discussed the differences between these two approaches at the beginning of the semester, but a brief review can be found at:

The publications we will discuss are the following:

1) https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b04377  (AIMD for spectroscopy)
2) https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c02660 (AIMD for reaction mechanisms)
3) https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c02987 (nonBO AIMD for excited state dynamics)
